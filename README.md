# Collapse - Minimize Content Element Preview Size in TYPO3's Page Module

This TYPO3 extension provides functionality to expand or collapse the
Content Element details within the TYPO3 Page Module.

TYPO3's page module will show arrow up / down buttons on
each content element on the right side.

This is especially useful if you have a lot of content or are using nested
content elements.

The current state - if an element is expanded or collapsed - is stored
within the users' settings "UC".
